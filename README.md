## Overview
This is a Discord bot that sends messages daily. It sends out the weather (temp high, low, mean, sunny, rainy, etc.) for the day. If the temperature exceeds a threshold, the bot will also post an audio clip that will get more distorted as the temperature further exceeds the threshold.

**This bot is developed purely for fun, as there are probably other Discord bots out there that can post weather data just fine.**

## Features
- Choose the location to pull weather data from (TBD)
- Choose which channel to post in (TBD)
- Choose what time to post the weather (TBD)
- Choose the temperature units (TBD)
- Choose the temperature threshold to post the audio clip (TBD)

## Can I add this bot to my Discord server?
Currently unsure whether to make this a public bot, if people really want it then sure I guess. It's currently just a project for fun, but time will tell if this will become a "proper" bot that will see continuous development.
