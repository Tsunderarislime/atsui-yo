## Overview
This is a Discord bot that sends messages daily. It sends out the weather (temp high, low, sunny, rainy, etc.) for the day. If the temperature exceeds a threshold, the bot will also post an audio clip that will get more distorted as the temperature further exceeds the threshold. Set these parameters in the config file, then start the bot.

**This bot is developed purely for fun, as there are probably other Discord bots out there that can post weather data just fine.**

## Features
- Choose the location to pull weather data from
- Choose which channel to post in
- Choose what time to post the weather
- Choose the temperature threshold to post the audio clips
- Ask for the current weather with a 12-hour forecast

## Can I add this bot to my Discord server?
If you have a way to host it, then sure go ahead. You will have to modify *config.yml* though. You will have to obtain your own Discord bot token, choose the channel ID that this bot will post to, and generate your Open-Meteo API request URL to use with the bot.
